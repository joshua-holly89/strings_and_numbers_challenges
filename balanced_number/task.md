# Balanced Number

## Task

Given is a positive integer n.
Find the balanced number, which is a positive integer between 0 and n.
A number is balanced when the sum of all smaller integers is the same as the sum of all bigger integers until n (n is included).
If there is no balanced number, return -1.

## Example

n = 8
balanced number is 6, because
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 7 + 8 (= 15)
