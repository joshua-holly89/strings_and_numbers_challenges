# Count Ones in Binaries

## Task

Given is a natural number n.
Find all natural numbers from 0 to n.
For each of these numbers, find the count of set bits in their binary representation (i.e., the number of ones).
Return an array which contain these counts in correct order.

## Example

Input n = 5;
Output [0,1,1,2,1,2]
0 => 0 => 0 ones
1 => 1 => 1 ones
2 => 10 => 1 ones
3 => 11 => 2 ones
4 => 100 => 1 ones
5 => 101 => 2 ones
